## Introduction

This repository is a boilerplate for web application development using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.6 or higher.
- You have installed pip, Python's package manager.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project name>
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install all necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

You can run the application locally with Uvicorn, simply execute:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
